# Inspect native runtime registry counters

Returns process-local diagnostics for database-scoped native runtime
entries and their extension-owned DuckDB connections. The `con` argument
is only the enabled DuckDB connection used to reach the diagnostic SQL
functions; the counters are process-global, not scoped only to `con`.
`active_entries` means entries whose stored database handle has not been
marked as a stale registry alias, and `stale_entries` means entries
retained only to avoid reusing an old raw database address. DuckDB's C
extension API does not currently provide a clean database-close callback
for this package, so these counters are accounting diagnostics rather
than deterministic lifetime guarantees. `connections_current` and
`native_release_supported` are derived R-side summary fields. For
file-backed databases, Rducks closes extension-owned DuckDB connections
when the last Rducks attachment to a runtime is released; the
process-local runtime entry itself is retained as inert metadata so
catalog destructors and stale database-address detection remain safe.

## Usage

``` r
rducks_runtime_stats(con)
```

## Arguments

- con:

  An enabled `duckdb_connection`.

## Value

A one-row data frame with runtime registry and connection counters.

## Examples

``` r
# \donttest{
db <- duckdb::dbConnect(duckdb::duckdb(config = list(allow_unsigned_extensions = "true")))
#> duckdb keeps downloaded extensions and secrets in a temporary directory:
#> ℹ /tmp/RtmpqCR7r7/duckdb
#> This is removed when the R session ends.
#> • Extensions are re-downloaded each session.
#> • Secrets are lost.
#> ℹ Run duckdb(shared_home = TRUE) (or create ~/.duckdb) to keep them (suitable for most users).
#> ℹ Run duckdb(shared_home = FALSE) to accept the temporary directory (and silence this message).
#> ℹ See ?duckdb_storage for details and alternatives.
