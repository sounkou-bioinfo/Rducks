# Inspect preserved-object release counters

Returns process-local diagnostics for preserved R objects that native
DuckDB catalog metadata could not release immediately because
destruction happened off the recorded main R thread. Safe main-thread
drain points include
[`rducks_enable()`](https://rgenomicsetl.github.io/Rducks/reference/rducks_enable.md),
[`rducks_release()`](https://rgenomicsetl.github.io/Rducks/reference/rducks_release.md),
[`rducks_register_scalar_udf()`](https://rgenomicsetl.github.io/Rducks/reference/rducks_register_scalar_udf.md),
scalar-UDF execution, and metadata/stat queries.

## Usage

``` r
rducks_release_stats(con)
```

## Arguments

- con:

  A `duckdb_connection`.

## Value

A one-row data frame with queued, released, failed, and pending
counters.

## Examples

``` r
# \donttest{
db <- duckdb::dbConnect(duckdb::duckdb(config = list(allow_unsigned_extensions = "true")))
#> duckdb keeps downloaded extensions and secrets in a temporary directory:
#> ℹ /tmp/Rtmp7iTOSm/duckdb
#> This is removed when the R session ends.
#> • Extensions are re-downloaded each session.
#> • Secrets are lost.
#> ℹ Run duckdb(shared_home = TRUE) (or create ~/.duckdb) to keep them (suitable for most users).
#> ℹ Run duckdb(shared_home = FALSE) to accept the temporary directory (and silence this message).
#> ℹ See ?duckdb_storage for details and alternatives.
rducks_enable(db)
rducks_release_stats(db)
#>   queued released failed pending
#> 1      0        3      0       0
rducks_release(db)
DBI::dbDisconnect(db)
# }
```
