# Disable in-process queued scalar-UDF execution

Switches a Rducks-enabled DuckDB connection back to the direct serial
backend. Optionally updates DuckDB thread settings at the same time.

## Usage

``` r
rducks_disable_inproc(con, threads = NULL, external_threads = NULL)
```

## Arguments

- con:

  A `duckdb_connection`.

- threads:

  Optional positive integer to set with `PRAGMA threads`.

- external_threads:

  Optional positive integer to set with `SET external_threads`. Use
  `NULL` to leave unchanged.

## Value

`con`, invisibly.

## Examples

``` r
# \donttest{
db <- duckdb::dbConnect(duckdb::duckdb(config = list(allow_unsigned_extensions = "true")))
#> duckdb keeps downloaded extensions and secrets in a temporary directory:
#> ℹ /tmp/RtmpqCR7r7/duckdb
#> This is removed when the R session ends.
#> • Extensions are re-downloaded each session.
#> • Secrets are lost.
#> ℹ Run duckdb(shared_home = TRUE) (or create ~/.duckdb) to keep them (suitable for most users).
#> ℹ Run duckdb(shared_home = FALSE) to accept the temporary directory (and silence this message).
#> ℹ See ?duckdb_storage for details and alternatives.
