# Enable in-process queued scalar-UDF execution

Switches a Rducks-enabled DuckDB connection to an `inproc_concurrent`
execution plan for subsequent scalar-UDF registrations and updates the
native runtime backend. This backend preserves R's thread discipline:
DuckDB worker-side scalar-UDF callbacks submit chunk requests to an
extension-owned queue, and the recorded main R thread drains the queue
and performs all R API work. This is a same-process scheduling mode, not
a performance promise; R function calls are still serialized on the main
R thread.

## Usage

``` r
rducks_enable_inproc(con, threads = NULL, external_threads = NULL)
```

## Arguments

- con:

  A `duckdb_connection` already enabled with
  [`rducks_enable()`](https://rgenomicsetl.github.io/Rducks/reference/rducks_enable.md).

- threads:

  Optional positive integer to set with `PRAGMA threads` before enabling
  the in-process backend. Use `NULL` to leave unchanged.

- external_threads:

  Optional positive integer to set with `SET external_threads` before
  enabling the in-process backend. Use `NULL` to leave unchanged. For
  actual DuckDB worker concurrency, keep this smaller than `threads`
  (for example `threads = 4, external_threads = 1`).

## Value

`con`, invisibly.

## Details

This is a helper for the direct in-process queue. New code can call
[`rducks_set_execution_plan()`](https://rgenomicsetl.github.io/Rducks/reference/rducks_set_execution_plan.md)
directly with `rducks_execution_plan("inproc")`. Select the plan before
registering scalar UDFs whose reported execution plan should be the
queued in-process path.

## Examples

``` r
# \donttest{
db <- duckdb::dbConnect(duckdb::duckdb(config = list(allow_unsigned_extensions = "true")))
#> duckdb keeps downloaded extensions and secrets in a temporary directory:
#> ℹ /tmp/RtmpqCR7r7/duckdb
#> This is removed when the R session ends.
#> • Extensions are re-downloaded each session.
#> • Secrets are lost.
#> ℹ Run duckdb(shared_home = TRUE) (or create ~/.duckdb) to keep them (suitable for most users).
#> ℹ Run duckdb(shared_home = FALSE) to accept the temporary directory (and silence this message).
#> ℹ See ?duckdb_storage for details and alternatives.
rducks_enable(db)
rducks_enable_inproc(db)
rducks_release(db)
DBI::dbDisconnect(db)
