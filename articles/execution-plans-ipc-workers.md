# Execution Plans and IPC Workers

Execution plans apply to DuckDB scalar UDFs. They choose where a DuckDB
chunk is evaluated and how it is carried to the R function.

## Supported transports

- `transport = "inproc"` (the default): DuckDB vectors are materialized
  to SEXPs directly in extension C and the R function runs in the
  current R process. DuckDB callbacks may arrive off the recorded R
  thread; the in-process queued backend drains all R work on the
  recorded R thread, so R API work is never concurrent. Maps to the
  internal `direct_main_queue` engine.
- `transport = "ipc"`: the extension encodes each input chunk to Quack
  wire bytes (a DuckDB `BinarySerializer` `DataChunk` subset), ships it
  to a persistent worker R process over NNG, and decodes the
  wire-encoded result back into DuckDB. Maps to the internal
  `ipc_nng_pool` engine.

Unsupported combinations fail. Rducks does not silently fall back from
one transport to another. Both plans support `VARIANT` only when the
loaded DuckDB runtime passes Rducks’ canonical logical-type and
physical-vector-layout probe; an incompatible runtime rejects direct and
`ipc` registrations.

``` r

library(DBI)
library(duckdb)
library(Rducks)

con <- dbConnect(duckdb(config = list(allow_unsigned_extensions = "true")))
#> duckdb keeps downloaded extensions and secrets in a temporary directory:
#> ℹ /tmp/Rtmpt2Ov4h/duckdb
#> This is removed when the R session ends.
#> • Extensions are re-downloaded each session.
#> • Secrets are lost.
#> ℹ Run duckdb(shared_home = TRUE) (or create ~/.duckdb) to keep them (suitable for most users).
#> ℹ Run duckdb(shared_home = FALSE) to accept the temporary directory (and silence this message).
#> ℹ See ?duckdb_storage for details and alternatives.
rducks_enable(con, threads = "single")
```

## Select the plan before registration

The default execution plan stored on a connection is used for future
scalar-UDF registrations. Register UDFs under the plan you want to test
or deploy.

``` r

rducks_set_execution_plan(
  con,
  rducks_execution_plan("inproc")
)

rducks_register_scalar_udf(
  con,
  name = "r_plus_one",
  fun = function(x) x + 1L,
  args = INTEGER,
  returns = INTEGER
)
#> <rducks_scalar_udf_registration>
#>   registered:      yes
#>   name:            r_plus_one
#>   evaluation_mode: scalar
#>   plan:            direct+inproc_concurrent
#>   signature:       r_plus_one(INTEGER) -> INTEGER
```

For concurrent in-process execution, set the same plan again with wider
DuckDB thread settings before running queries, so the native runtime
backend matches the UDF metadata being exercised. R work still drains on
the recorded R thread.

``` r

rducks_set_execution_plan(
  con,
  rducks_execution_plan("inproc"),
  threads = 2L,
  external_threads = 2L
)
dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT sum(r_plus_one((i % 1000)::INTEGER)) AS total FROM range(20000) t(i)")
#>      total
#> 1 10010000
```

## Worker-process (`ipc`) plan

`transport = "ipc"` starts or connects to persistent R workers that
receive Quack wire-encoded chunks over NNG. Registration still happens
under single-thread DuckDB settings; widen `threads` /
`external_threads` afterwards for query execution. This vignette uses
loopback TCP for the local NNG transport because it is the most portable
choice for executed documentation builds; local IPC transports such as
`"ipc"`, `"unix"`, or Linux `"abstract"` remain available when supported
by the host. Windows documentation builds also use a longer
startup/register timeout because worker process startup can be slower
there.

``` r

ipc_workers <- 1L
ipc_transport <- "tcp"
ipc_timeout <- if (identical(Sys.info()[["sysname"]], "Windows")) 120 else 30

ipc_available <- TRUE
ipc_start_error <- NULL
tryCatch({
  rducks_set_execution_plan(
    con,
    rducks_execution_plan(
      "ipc",
      ipc_workers = ipc_workers,
      ipc_transport = ipc_transport,
      ipc_timeout = ipc_timeout
    ),
    threads = 1L,
    external_threads = 1L
  )

  rducks_register_scalar_udf(
    con,
    name = "r_slow_square",
    fun = function(x) {
      Sys.sleep(0.1)
      x * x
    },
    args = DOUBLE,
    returns = DOUBLE,
    mode = "vectorized",
    side_effects = TRUE
  )

  rducks_set_execution_plan(
    con,
    rducks_execution_plan(
      "ipc",
      ipc_workers = ipc_workers,
      ipc_transport = ipc_transport,
      ipc_timeout = ipc_timeout
    ),
    threads = ipc_workers + 1L,
    external_threads = ipc_workers
  )
}, error = function(e) {
  ipc_available <<- FALSE
  ipc_start_error <<- conditionMessage(e)
  message("IPC worker demo unavailable on this host: ", ipc_start_error)
})
```

Managed startup occurs during registration. Rducks starts local mirai
workers, launches the NNG worker loop, pings each endpoint, then
broadcasts the closure, type metadata, NULL/error policy, packages, and
selected globals. If `ipc_endpoints` is supplied, those endpoints are
caller-owned worker processes; Rducks connects to them but does not stop
them. Set `ipc_globals_share = "mori"` to pass large selected globals to
the workers through [mori](https://shikokuchuo.net/mori/) shared memory
instead of serializing them.

## Inspect workers

[`rducks_ipc_workers()`](https://rgenomicsetl.github.io/Rducks/reference/rducks_ipc_workers.md)
lists IPC providers known to the current R process. With `ping = TRUE`,
it also checks whether each endpoint responds.

``` r

if (isTRUE(ipc_available)) {
  rducks_ipc_workers(con)
  rducks_ipc_workers(con, ping = TRUE, timeout = min(ipc_timeout, 30))
} else {
  data.frame(status = "unavailable", reason = ipc_start_error)
}
#> <rducks_ipc_workers: 1 worker>
#>             runtime backend transport worker started task_state ping
#>  rducks-runtime-1-1   mirai       tcp    1/1    TRUE    running   ok
#>               endpoint
#>  tcp://127.0.0.1:44464
```

The result is an R-side provider view: runtime token, provider key,
backend, transport, endpoint, compute name, worker index, task state,
and optional ping status. It is not a DuckDB catalog listing.

## What `rducks_release()` does

`rducks_release(con)` detaches the connection-local Rducks state. It
also gives native code a safe main-thread point to release preserved R
objects that had to be queued by off-main destructors.

If this connection is the last Rducks attachment to the DuckDB runtime,
[`rducks_release()`](https://rgenomicsetl.github.io/Rducks/reference/rducks_release.md)
additionally:

1.  asks the native extension to close local NNG client pools for that
    runtime
2.  keeps caller-supplied external endpoints alive
3.  sends stop requests to Rducks-managed local worker endpoints
4.  waits briefly for mirai tasks to resolve and collects resolved tasks
5.  tears down the local mirai compute with
    `mirai::daemons(0, .compute = ...)`
6.  unlinks local IPC socket paths
7.  removes the provider entry from the process-local store

It does **not** unregister DuckDB catalog functions and does not release
closures still owned by live native catalog metadata. Re-register the
same SQL name/signature to replace a scalar UDF implementation.

Weak-reference finalizers provide best-effort cleanup if a connection
object is garbage-collected, but deterministic code should call
`rducks_release(con)` before `DBI::dbDisconnect(con)`.
