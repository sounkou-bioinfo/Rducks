# duckplyr Integration

Rducks can make selected ordinary R calls inside a duckplyr pipeline
available as DuckDB scalar UDF calls. The goal is not to emulate dplyr
fallback in R; the goal is to keep the pipeline in DuckDB while DuckDB
calls registered Rducks functions for the operations you explicitly opt
into.

## Setup

Use a DuckDB connection with unsigned extension loading enabled and
enable Rducks on that connection. `threads = "single"` is the
recommended registration setting for R-backed functions.

``` r

suppressPackageStartupMessages({
  library(DBI)
  library(dplyr)
  library(duckdb)
  library(duckplyr)
  library(Rducks)
})

con <- DBI::dbConnect(
  duckdb::duckdb(config = list(allow_unsigned_extensions = "true")),
  dbdir = ":memory:"
)
#> duckdb keeps downloaded extensions and secrets in a temporary directory:
#> ℹ /tmp/Rtmp4VLeOH/duckdb
#> This is removed when the R session ends.
#> • Extensions are re-downloaded each session.
#> • Secrets are lost.
#> ℹ Run duckdb(shared_home = TRUE) (or create ~/.duckdb) to keep them (suitable for most users).
#> ℹ Run duckdb(shared_home = FALSE) to accept the temporary directory (and silence this message).
#> ℹ See ?duckdb_storage for details and alternatives.
rducks_enable(con, threads = "single")

input <- data.frame(
  id = 1:6,
  x = as.numeric(c(2, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34)),
  label = c("low", "low", "mid", "mid", "high", "high")
)
DBI::dbWriteTable(con, "duckplyr_scores", input)

scores <- duckplyr::read_sql_duckdb(
  "SELECT * FROM duckplyr_scores",
  con = con,
  prudence = "stingy"
)
```

## Why a bridge is needed

A plain R helper in a duckplyr expression is not automatically a DuckDB
SQL function. With stingy fallback and fallback collection disabled,
duckplyr should fail instead of silently pulling data back to R.

``` r

local_score <- function(x, label) {
  bonus <- if (identical(label, "high")) 100 else if (identical(label, "mid")) 10 else 0
  as.double(x + bonus)
}

blocked <- with_duckplyr_fallback_disabled(tryCatch({
  scores |>
    mutate(score = local_score(x, label)) |>
    collect()
  FALSE
}, error = function(e) {
  message("fallback blocked: ", conditionMessage(e))
  TRUE
}))
#> fallback blocked: This operation cannot be carried out by DuckDB, and the input is a
#> stingy duckplyr frame.
#> ℹ Use `compute(prudence = "lavish")` to materialize to temporary storage and
#>   continue with duckplyr.
#> ℹ See `vignette("prudence")` for other options.
#> Caused by error in `mutate()`:
#> ! Can't translate function `local_score()`.
stopifnot(isTRUE(blocked))
```

## Register selected R helpers for duckplyr

[`rducks_with_duckplyr()`](https://rgenomicsetl.github.io/Rducks/reference/rducks_with_duckplyr.md)
captures the duckplyr expression, registers the named R helpers as
dynamic-argument Rducks scalar UDFs, rewrites matching calls to
DuckDB-function calls, and evaluates the rewritten expression. DuckDB
still needs an explicit return type for every registered helper.

``` r

out <- rducks_with_duckplyr(
  con,
  scores |>
    mutate(score = local_score(x, label)) |>
    filter(score >= 100) |>
    select(id, label, score) |>
    arrange(id) |>
    collect(),
  returns = list(local_score = DOUBLE)
)
out
#> # A tibble: 2 × 3
#>      id label score
#> * <int> <chr> <dbl>
#> 1     5 high    121
#> 2     6 high    134
```

The
[`with.duckdb_connection()`](https://rgenomicsetl.github.io/Rducks/reference/rducks_with_duckplyr.md)
method is equivalent when `rducks_returns` is supplied:

``` r

out_with <- with(
  con,
  scores |>
    mutate(score = local_score(x, label)) |>
    filter(score >= 100) |>
    select(id, label, score) |>
    arrange(id) |>
    collect(),
  rducks_returns = list(local_score = DOUBLE)
)
identical(out_with, out)
#> [1] TRUE
```

## Why scalar mode is the default

A duckplyr call such as `local_score(x, label)` is translated as a SQL
scalar function call in a relational expression. That SQL surface is
row-oriented: DuckDB sees one logical value for each argument and needs
one logical result. Rducks therefore defaults the bridge to
`mode = "scalar"`, which lets ordinary R helpers be written as row
functions.

Rducks scalar-UDF *evaluation mode* is still an implementation choice
behind that SQL scalar function. If a helper is vectorized over whole
chunks and returns a vector of the same length, the duckplyr bridge can
register it with `mode = "vectorized"`:

``` r

local_score_vec <- function(x, label) {
  as.double(x + ifelse(label == "high", 100, ifelse(label == "mid", 10, 0)))
}

out_vec <- rducks_with_duckplyr(
  con,
  scores |>
    mutate(score = local_score_vec(x, label)) |>
    filter(score >= 100) |>
    select(id, label, score) |>
    arrange(id) |>
    collect(),
  returns = list(local_score_vec = DOUBLE),
  mode = "vectorized"
)
identical(out_vec, out)
#> [1] TRUE
```

The [`with()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/with.html) method exposes the same
choice as `rducks_mode`.

## Execution plans: in-process and worker-process

Do not confuse `mode = "scalar"` / `"vectorized"` with the Rducks
execution plan. The mode controls whether the R closure is called per
row or per DuckDB chunk. The execution plan controls the transport
(`transport = "inproc"` in the current R process, or `transport = "ipc"`
in worker R processes). The duckplyr bridge uses the current connection
plan at the time it registers helpers.

For example, this executed chunk pins the in-process plan before
registering and evaluating a duckplyr helper:

``` r

rducks_set_execution_plan(
  con,
  rducks_execution_plan("inproc"),
  threads = 1L,
  external_threads = 1L
)

local_plus_c <- function(x) as.double(x + 1)

rducks_with_duckplyr(
  con,
  scores |>
    mutate(y = local_plus_c(x)) |>
    select(id, y) |>
    arrange(id) |>
    collect(),
  returns = list(local_plus_c = DOUBLE),
  mode = "vectorized"
)
#> # A tibble: 6 × 2
#>      id     y
#> * <int> <dbl>
#> 1     1     3
#> 2     2     6
#> 3     3     9
#> 4     4    14
#> 5     5    22
#> 6     6    35
```

Worker-process execution is the same axis: select a `transport = "ipc"`
plan before registering the helper. The high-level duckplyr bridge
registers helpers and evaluates the expression in one call, so it is
best for simple runs or for plans whose registration and execution
thread settings are the same. If you need the full pattern of
registering under single-thread DuckDB settings and then widening
`threads` / `external_threads` for a parallel `ipc` query, register the
UDF explicitly with
[`rducks_register_scalar_udf()`](https://rgenomicsetl.github.io/Rducks/reference/rducks_register_scalar_udf.md)
and call it from duckplyr via duckplyr’s `dd$function_name(...)` SQL
escape hatch, or wrap that two-phase pattern in your own helper.

## Cleanup

``` r

rducks_release(con)
DBI::dbDisconnect(con, shutdown = TRUE)
```
